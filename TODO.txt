Was writing the pop_ad and shift_ad fxns


Overall:
    Initialization function?
        Need to initialize bfuncdb at least... Maybe some of the bparse stuff as well.

bparse:
    * Rewrite tokenization function - DONE
    * REALLY need to reename the 'defs' stuff to be 'operators'
    Collapse tokens when processing

    When reading a line of tokens, copy one token at a time into a new deque. Parse each token as it comes in, decide if there is an operation to perform, if there is do it, else go on to the next token. When the end of the deque is reached, keep parsing over the duplicated list until it is done.
    Should define what 'done' means.

bdeque:
    * Have bdeques keep track of their length - DONE
    * Change d_elem values from chars to bvars - DONE
    write bdeque_concat
    fix bdeque_copy
    write bdeque_sort
    make fast sorting bdeques that are doubly linked skip lists
    

bfunc:

Future features:
    Floating point support
    Implicit and explicit parallelism
    pure functions
        Pure functions can be implicitly parallelized due to not relying on outside variables
    Memoization for pure functions

* Make a Remove whitespace function - DONE
